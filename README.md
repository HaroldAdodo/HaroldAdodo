- 👋 Hi, I’m Harold Adodo Nikoue
- 👀 I’m interested in using computation to make better decsions
- 🌱 I’m currently learning constraint programming (http://www.minicp.org/) and about to start diving deep into deep learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development of sequential decision making tools and ML recommendation systems
- 📫 How to reach me by email at Harold_Nikoue-wm at discovery dot com

I love learning more about applications of Machine Learning, mathematical programming and optimal control to affect real daily life problems.
